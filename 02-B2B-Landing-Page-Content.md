> **diBoaS pays:** 7% = €70,000/year
> 
> That's **€65,000 in potential runway** you're leaving on the table.
> 
> Same money. Same liquidity. 14x more return.

**Step 3: EARN**
> Your allocated cash earns 6-8% APY through battle-tested DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound).

**Step 4: WITHDRAW**
> Need cash for payroll? One click. Same-day settlement. No lock-ups. No penalties.

**Footer Note:**
> Monthly statements compatible with your accountant.

---

## SECTION 5: USE CASES

**Header:**
> Who uses diBoaS Treasury?

**Use Case 1: Post-Fundraise**
> Just closed a round? Put that capital to work while you're hiring and scaling.
> 
> *"We had €3M sitting in a bank account earning nothing for 6 months. That was €100K in missed yield."*

**Use Case 2: Between Rounds**
> Bridge runway between funding rounds by earning on your reserves.
> 
> *"The extra €40K/year is basically a free junior hire."*

**Use Case 3: Operating Reserves**
> Keep payroll covered while excess cash earns yield.
> 
> *"We set a €100K floor. Everything above earns 7%. Simple."*

---

## SECTION 6: SOCIAL PROOF

**Header:**
> Trusted by forward-thinking founders

**Testimonial 1:**
> "We were skeptical at first. But the math was obvious. €70K extra runway per year, with same liquidity. Our board actually thanked us."
> — CFO, Series A SaaS Company

**Testimonial 2:**
> "I wish we'd done this from day one. We left €30K on the table in our first year."
> — Founder, Seed-stage startup

**Metrics Box:**
> | Metric | Value |
> |--------|-------|
> | Combined treasury under management | €2.5M |
> | Average client yield | 7.2% APY |
> | Average time to onboard | 48 hours |

## SECTION 7: FAQ

**Header:**
> Founder FAQs

**Q: What will my investors think?**
> Most sophisticated investors expect treasury optimization. Earning 7% vs 0.5% extends runway. We provide board-ready materials to help you communicate this clearly.

**Q: What about compliance and audits?**
> We provide full documentation compatible with standard accounting practices. Your accountant will receive monthly statements with all the detail they need.

**Q: What if I need cash for payroll or unexpected costs?**
> Same-day withdrawals. No lock-ups. Set a liquidity threshold and we'll never deploy below that amount. You're always covered.

**Q: What's the risk?**
> DeFi protocols carry smart contract risk. We mitigate this by using only battle-tested protocols with $10B+ TVL and multiple audits. No investment is risk-free — we're transparent about that.

**Q: How do you make money?**
> We take a 0.12% fee on yield earned. If you earn nothing, we earn nothing. Our incentives are aligned.

**Q: What's the minimum?**
> We work with startups managing €50K+ in operating cash. Below that, the yield may not justify the setup time.

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
> Most companies are fully onboarded within 48 hours. Setup itself takes about 15 minutes.

## RISK DISCLAIMER (Footer)

> *Projected yields are illustrative based on current DeFi market rates (as of [DATE]). Rates are variable and not guaranteed. Past performance does not indicate future results.
