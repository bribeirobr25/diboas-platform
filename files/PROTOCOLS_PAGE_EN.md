# WHERE YOUR MONEY WORKS
## The Protocols We Trust — English Version

*diBoaS connects you to established decentralized finance protocols. Here's exactly where your money goes.*

---

## Why This Page Exists

We believe you should know exactly where your money works. Unlike traditional banks that hide what they do with your deposits, we show you everything.

Every protocol listed here has been researched, tested, and approved by our team. We look at security audits, track record, and how long they've been operating. If we wouldn't put our own money there, we won't put yours there either.

**Important:** Being on this list doesn't mean zero risk. It means we've done our homework and trust these protocols enough to include them in our strategies.

## Our Selection Process

We don't add protocols randomly. Every protocol here passed our checklist:

✅ **At least 1 year of operation** (with few exceptions for exceptional protocols)  
✅ **Professional security audits** from recognized firms  
✅ **No unresolved exploits** where user funds were lost and not recovered  
✅ **Transparent operations** — we can verify how the protocol works  
✅ **Real usage** — actual users, not just hype  

When protocols have had security incidents, we note them clearly. Transparency works both ways.

---

## Total Combined TVL

The protocols we work with collectively secure over **$120 billion** in user deposits.

This doesn't mean your money is in all of them. Each diBoaS strategy uses specific protocols suited to its risk level and goals.

---

## Questions?

**Why don't you list every DeFi protocol?**  
We're selective. Most DeFi protocols don't meet our standards.

**How often do you update this list?**  
We continuously monitor all protocols. If something changes, we'll add or remove as needed.

**Can I request a protocol to be added?**  
Yes. Contact us at hello@diboas.com with your suggestion.
