# diBoaS Viral Sharing Content
## REVISED FINAL VERSION — Educational Framing, Knowledge Sharing

---

# SHARING PHILOSOPHY

## Core Insight
> People share knowledge they've gained, not sales pitches they've received.

## Voice
> "Let me show you something I learned" — not "Look what I got"

## Framing Shift
| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| "I earned X while sleeping" | "Here's something I learned about money" |
| "Join the movement" | "You might find this interesting" |
| "Banks are lying" | "Here's what banks don't explain" |
| Achievement/bragging | Learning/sharing |

## Movement Hashtag

# PART 1: KNOWLEDGE-SHARING CARD SYSTEM

## Overview

The #WhileISlept card is an educational artifact. It shares knowledge, not achievements. The framing is: "I learned something — you might want to know this too."

## Card Design: Learning Card (Primary)

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│   💡 Something I just learned:      │
│                                     │
│   Banks earn 7% with our savings.   │
│   They pay us 0.5%.                 │
│                                     │
│   That gap? It's been there         │
│   the whole time.                   │
│                                     │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Educational, not boastful
- Shares knowledge, invites curiosity
- No numbers about personal gains
- Focuses on the insight, not the individual

# PART 2: MONTHLY RITUAL — "THE MONTHLY LEARNING"

## Overview

Instead of celebrating earnings, celebrate learning. The monthly moment is about collective discovery, not collective gains.

## Bar's Monthly Video Script

**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Tone:** Reflective, grateful. Sharing, not celebrating.

> [Bar, casual setting]
>
> "Hey everyone. First of the month.
>
> [X] people learned something new about money this month. About how banks work. About the gap that's always been there.
>
> My grandmother never got to learn this. She did everything right — saved half of everything — and it still wasn't enough.
>
> Now you know what she didn't. And you're sharing it with others.
>
> That matters to me.
>
> Thanks for being curious.
>
> [End card: #WhileISlept]"

---

## Monthly Email Template

**Subject:** [Month] — What we learned together

> Hey [Name],
>
> First of the month.
>
> **This month:**
> - [X] new people joined the waitlist
> - [X] people shared what they learned
> - [X] countries now represented
>
> Every person who learns about the gap between what banks earn and what they pay is one more person who knows what my grandmother never did.
>
> Thanks for being part of this.
>
> Bar
>
> P.S. — Know someone who'd find this interesting? [Share link]

---

# PART 3: REFERRAL PROGRAM

## Framing

**Old:** "Invite friends, get rewards"
**New:** "Know someone who'd find this interesting?"

---

## Mechanics

- User joins waitlist → Gets position #X
- User shares → Friends who join move them up
- Position = earlier access

**Language:**
> "Every person who joins through your link moves you up 10 spots. More importantly — they'll learn what you just learned."

---

## Referral URL

**Format:** `diboas.com/join/[CODE]`

---

## Reward Recognition (Subtle)

| Referrals | Recognition | Note |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| 5 | "Early Learner" | Shared with 5 people |
| 10 | "Knowledge Spreader" | Shared with 10 people |
| 25 | "Founding Learner" | Early community member |

**Note:** Badges are subtle, not flashy. The reward is earlier access and community recognition, not status.

---

# PART 4: TEXT MESSAGES (Backup)

## Note
Cards are primary. Text is for platforms that don't support images well, or for personal messages.

---

## ENGLISH (EN)

### Twitter/X

> 
> #WhileISlept

### WhatsApp/iMessage

**Option 1 — Personal:**
> Hey! Learned something interesting about how banks work. They earn like 7% with our savings and pay us 0.5%. The gap is huge.

> 
> Worth understanding the math: diboas.com

## Script

> [Bar, casual setting, natural light]
>
> "I want to share something I learned.
>
> My grandmother saved half of everything she earned. Her whole life. Disciplined. Patient. Did everything right.
>
> It still wasn't enough.
>
> Three years ago, I decided to understand why.

> Here's what I found: Banks pay us 0.5% on savings. They earn about 7% with that money. The difference — that gap — has been there the whole time. For my grandmother. For yours. For all of us.
>
> Once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.
>
> So I'm building diBoaS — to close that gap. To give ordinary people the same rates banks earn.

# PART 8: WHAT NOT TO DO

## Avoid These Framings

| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Instead Say |
|-------------|---------------|
| "I earned €X while sleeping" | "Here's something I learned about money" |
| "Banks are stealing from us" | "Here's what banks don't explain" |
| "Join the movement" | "You might find this interesting" |
| "I'm #847 on the waitlist" | "I'm learning something new about money" |
| "Get in early" | "Worth understanding" |
| "They lied to us" | "There's something they didn't tell us" |
| "She died with nothing" | "It still wasn't enough" |
| "I grew up poor" | "I'm from Rio" |

## Why This Matters

- Educational framing builds trust
- Learning is shareable; bragging isn't (for most people)
- Curiosity spreads better than outrage
- Bar's voice is teacher, not warrior
