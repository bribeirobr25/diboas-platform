## REVISED FINAL VERSION — Teacher Voice, Consultative Approach

---

# VOICE FOUNDATION

## Tone

## CALL SCRIPT

### OPENING (1-2 minutes)

**[If they booked the call]**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for making time. I know founder schedules are packed. How's [company name] going? What's keeping you busy?"

*[Brief rapport. Don't rush, but don't overdo it.]*

**[If reaching out cold]**
> "Hey [Name], this is Bar from diBoaS. I know this is out of the blue — do you have 2 minutes? I want to share something about startup treasury that might be interesting. If not, no worries."

---

### CONTEXT (30 seconds)

**Share your perspective:**
> "Quick context on why I'm doing this: I'm from Rio. My grandmother saved half of everything she earned her whole life. It still wasn't enough.
>
> I spent three years understanding why — the gap between what banks earn with our money and what they pay us. Same thing happens with startup treasury.
>
> That's what I'm building around. Let me show you the math."

---

### DISCOVERY (3-4 minutes)

**Ask about their situation:**

**Question 1:**
> "You raised [€X] about [Y] months ago. Roughly, how much operating cash is sitting in your account right now?"

*[Listen. Take notes.]*

**Question 2:**
> "And what's it earning? Most business accounts are around 0-0.5%, right?"

*[They'll confirm.]*

**Question 3:**
> "Has your team ever looked at doing something with that idle cash? Or has it just not been a priority?"

*[Understand if they've thought about this before.]*

---

### EDUCATION (3-4 minutes)

**Walk through the math:**

> "Okay, let me show you something interesting. You have roughly €[X] sitting there earning [0.5%].
>
> Here's what most founders don't know: your bank is earning about 7% with that money. They lend it out, invest it, and keep most of the return.
>
> So on €[X]:
> - Your bank earns: €[X × 0.07]/year
> - Your bank pays you: €[X × 0.005]/year  
> - The difference: €[difference]/year
>
> That difference is runway. It could be yours.
>
> What we do is connect you to the same rates — 6-8% — through DeFi protocols. Same-day liquidity. You set a threshold so you always have cash available.
>
> **Does that math make sense? Any questions about how it works?**"

*[Pause. Let them process. Answer questions.]*

---

### HONEST ASSESSMENT (2 minutes)

**Based on their reaction:**

**[If they seem interested]**
> "Based on your numbers, this could mean €[X] extra per year. That's meaningful.
>
> There are real considerations though: DeFi protocols have smart contract risk. We mitigate it with battle-tested protocols, but it's not zero risk.
>
> Is that trade-off something you'd be comfortable with?"

**[If they have concerns]**
> "What's your main concern? Let me address it directly."

**[If it doesn't fit]**
> "Honestly, with €[X] in treasury, the numbers might not justify the setup time right now. When you raise more, this could make more sense. Want me to check back in 6 months?"

---

### OBJECTIONS (Handle as Education)

**"What's the risk?"**
> "Good question. Let me be specific:
>
> DeFi protocols are smart contracts — code that can have bugs. That's the main risk.
>
> How we mitigate it: we only use protocols with $10B+ secured for years, multiple independent audits. Aave, Compound — infrastructure that institutions use.
>
> Is it zero risk? No. Is it 14x better yield for calculated risk? That's the question. Some founders say yes, some say no. Both are valid."

**"My board won't approve this."**
> "Maybe not — boards can be conservative. Let me send you materials that explain the risk/return clearly. If it doesn't make sense for your board, that's okay. At least you'll have the information."

**"I need to think about it."**
> "Of course. Want me to send a one-pager you can share with your co-founder? No pressure on timing."

**"We're too early for this."**
> "Fair. Focus matters more than optimization at early stage. Want me to check back when you've raised more? I'll add you to a list."

**"I don't understand DeFi."**
> "You don't need to. Think of it like using Stripe without understanding payment processing. You see: deposit, yield, withdraw. We handle the complexity.
>
> Want me to walk you through the demo so you can see how simple it actually is?"

---

### CLOSE (2 minutes)

**[If they're interested]**
> "It sounds like this could make sense for you. Here's what I'd suggest:
>
> I can send you a Letter of Intent — non-binding, just says you're interested. It helps us show demand, and gets you early access.
>
> Takes 2 minutes to review. Want me to send it over?"

**[If they want to think]**
> "No problem. I'll send you the one-pager and LOI. Look at it when you have time. If it makes sense, sign it. If not, no worries. I'd rather you make the right decision."

**[If it's not a fit]**
> "Sounds like the timing isn't right. Appreciate you taking the time to learn about it. If anything changes, you know where to find me."

---

### POST-CALL (5 minutes after)

- [ ] Send thank-you email with promised materials
- [ ] Send LOI if they agreed
- [ ] Log notes (cash position, concerns, interest level)
- [ ] Schedule follow-up if needed

---

# PART 2: OBJECTION HANDLING (Educational Framing)

---

## Core Principle
Every objection is a chance to teach, not overcome. Share information, let them decide.

---

### "It's too risky."

**Acknowledge:** 
> "Risk is worth understanding clearly."

**Educate:**
> "Here's how I think about it: Your bank deposits feel safe because they're insured up to €100K. But the bank is taking risks with your money constantly — they just don't tell you about it.
>
> DeFi has different risks. Smart contracts can have bugs. We use protocols that have secured $10B+ for years without major incidents, but it's not zero.
>
> The question is: is 14x better yield worth a different risk profile? For some founders, yes. For others, no. Both are valid choices."

---

### "My board won't approve."

**Acknowledge:**
> "Boards can be conservative about treasury."

**Educate:**
> "Here's what might help: we have board-ready materials that explain exactly how it works, what the risks are, and how we mitigate them. No crypto jargon.
>
> Some boards approve it, some don't. At least yours will have clear information to decide."

**Offer:**
> "Want me to send those materials? You can share with your board and see how they react."

---

### "I don't understand DeFi."

**Acknowledge:**
> "Most people don't — that's normal."

**Educate:**
> "Here's what you need to know: DeFi protocols are like financial infrastructure. You don't need to understand how they work, just like you don't need to understand how Visa processes payments.
>
> Your experience is: deposit money, see it earn, withdraw when you want. We handle everything technical."

**Offer:**
> "Want to try the demo? You'll see how simple it actually is."

---

### "We already have a solution."

**Curious:**
> "Oh interesting — what are you using?"

**[If money market / bonds:]**
> "Those are solid options. How do the yields compare? We're typically seeing 6-8% vs 4-5% for money markets. Might be worth comparing."

**[If another treasury platform:]**
> "Good to know. How's your experience been? Always curious how we compare."

---

### "What if you go out of business?"

**Educate:**
> "Important question. Here's the key thing: we're non-custodial. We never hold your money.
>
> Your funds stay in your own wallet, deployed to protocols you can access directly. Even if diBoaS disappeared tomorrow, your money is still yours. We just provide the interface."

---

### "The yields seem too high."

**Educate:**
> "7% does sound high compared to bank savings — but here's why:
>
> Banks pay you 0.5% because they're earning 7% and keeping the spread. That's their business model.
>
> DeFi protocols don't have the same overhead. The rates are real — you can check Aave's current rates publicly at aave.com.
>
> We're not creating yield. We're giving you access to yield that's always existed — just not for ordinary people."

---

## Follow-Up Email (After "Need to Think")

**Subject:** Following up — diBoaS

> Hey [Name],
>
> Wanted to check if you had a chance to look at the materials.
>
> Quick reminder: €[X] in treasury at 7% = €[difference]/year more than your bank. That's runway.
>
> Happy to hop on a quick call if you have questions, or loop in your co-founder.
>
> Bar

---

## Follow-Up Email (After "Not Now")

**Subject:** Checking in — diBoaS

> Hey [Name],
>
> Hope [company name] is going well!
>
> When we talked [X months ago], timing wasn't right for treasury optimization. Wanted to check if anything's changed.
>
> We're live now with early customers — average yield is holding at 7.2%.
>
> Worth a 10-minute call to revisit?
>
> Bar

---

## Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** Something interesting about your treasury

> Hey [Name],
>
> Quick question: what's your startup's cash earning right now?
>
> Here's something most founders don't know: if it's in a business account at 0-0.5%, your bank is earning about 7% with that money — and keeping the difference.
>
> On €500K, that's €35K/year. Could be yours.
>
> I'm building diBoaS to close that gap. 6-8% yield, same-day liquidity, EU-regulated.
>
> Worth 15 minutes to look at your specific numbers?
>
> Bar
> Founder, diBoaS
>
> P.S. — Why am I building this? My grandmother saved half of everything she earned. It still wasn't enough. The gap between what banks earn and what they pay has always existed. Now founders can close it.

## diBoaS Treasury — One-Pager

**[For sharing with co-founders, CFOs, boards]**

### The Math

Your startup's treasury is earning 0-0.5%.
Your bank is earning 7% with that money — and keeping the spread.

| Treasury Size | Bank Pays (0.5%) | Bank Earns (7%) | You're Missing |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| €100K | €500/year | €7,000/year | €6,500 |
| €250K | €1,250/year | €17,500/year | €16,250 |
| €500K | €2,500/year | €35,000/year | €32,500 |
| €1M | €5,000/year | €70,000/year | €65,000 |

---

### What diBoaS Does

---

### How It Works

4. **Withdraw** anytime, same day

---

### Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | How We Mitigate |
|------|-----------------|
| Smart contract risk | Only protocols with $10B+ TVL, multiple audits |

| Regulatory risk | EU MiCA framework, pending CASP authorization |
| Counterparty risk | Non-custodial — funds stay in your wallet |

---

### Why I'm Building This

> "My grandmother saved half of everything she earned. It still wasn't enough.
>
> The gap between what banks earn and what they pay has always existed. For families like mine, it was invisible. For founders, it doesn't have to be."
