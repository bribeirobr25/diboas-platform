**Uncomfortable Truth Line:**
> Your bank is earning 7% — with your money.

> That €65,000 difference? That's your runway.

> diBoaS Treasury: 6-8% yield on operating cash.
> Same-day liquidity. No lock-up. EU-regulated.

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM

**Header:**
> The startup treasury problem nobody talks about

**Body Copy:**
> You raised €2M. You'll spend it over 18 months.
> That means €1M+ sits idle at any given time.
>
> Here's what your bank doesn't tell you:
>
> **Your bank pays:** 0.5% = €5,000/year
> **Your bank earns:** 7% = €70,000/year — with YOUR money
> **diBoaS pays:** 7% = €70,000/year — to YOU
>
> That's **€65,000 in potential runway** your bank is keeping.
>
> Same money. Same liquidity. The only difference? Who benefits.

**CTA:**
> Calculate your potential →

## SECTION 2: WHY WE BUILT THIS - NEW SECTION

**Header:**
> This isn't just about yields. It's about fairness.

**Body Copy:**
> The same system that kept my grandmother poor — a woman who saved half of everything she earned and still died with nothing — is the same system keeping your startup's cash idle.
>
> Banks take your money, earn returns, and give you almost nothing back. They've done this for generations. They do it to families. They do it to founders.
>
> **We believe founders deserve what banks keep for themselves.**
>
> diBoaS Treasury exists because the playing field should be level — whether you're a grandmother in Rio de Janeiro or a founder in Berlin.

**Signature:**
> — Bar, Founder

## SECTION 4: HOW IT WORKS

**Header:**
> How diBoaS Treasury works

**Step 1: CONNECT**
> Link your business bank account. 2-minute setup. No technical integration required.

**Step 2: ALLOCATE**
> Choose how much idle cash to deploy. Set your liquidity threshold (e.g., "always keep €50K available"). We'll never deploy below that.

**Step 3: EARN**
> Your allocated cash earns 6-8% APY through battle-tested DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound). The same rates banks earn — now yours.

**Step 4: WITHDRAW**
> Need cash for payroll? One click. Same-day settlement. No lock-ups. No penalties. No questions.

**Footer Note:**
> Monthly statements compatible with your accountant. Board-ready reporting included.

---

## SECTION 5: TRUST & COMPLIANCE

**Header:**
> Built for compliance-conscious teams

**Trust Point 1:**
> ✓ **EU-Regulated**
> Operating under MiCA framework with pending CASP authorization in Lithuania.

**Trust Point 2:**
> ✓ **Non-Custodial**
> Your funds remain in your control. We never hold your money. We just show you where to put it.

**Trust Point 3:**
> ✓ **Audited Protocols**
> We only use protocols with $10B+ TVL and multiple security audits. The same infrastructure institutions use.

**Trust Point 4:**
> ✓ **Transparent Reporting**
> Monthly statements. Real-time dashboard. Full audit trail for your finance team.

**Trust Point 5:**
> ✓ **Board-Ready**
> Professional reporting that your CFO and board will understand. No crypto jargon.

---

## SECTION 6: WHO THIS IS FOR

**Header:**
> Is diBoaS Treasury right for you?

**Good Fit:**
> ✓ Startups with €50K+ in operating cash
> ✓ 12-24 month runway you're slowly spending down
> ✓ Finance team that wants professional reporting
> ✓ Founders tired of watching cash earn nothing

**Not a Fit:**
> ✗ Need 100% of cash immediately accessible (we require a liquidity buffer)
> ✗ Looking for guaranteed returns (DeFi yields are variable)
> ✗ Not comfortable with any smart contract risk

**Honest Note:**
> We're not for everyone. If you need absolute certainty, a bank savings account — even at 0.5% — might be right for you. But if you're comfortable with calculated risk and want your money working as hard as you do, let's talk.

---

## SECTION 7: FAQ

**Header:**
> Questions founders ask

**Q: What's the catch?**
> No catch. We take a 0.12% fee on yield earned. If you earn nothing, we earn nothing. Our success depends on your success.
>
> The real question is: what's the catch with your current bank? They're earning 7% on your money and paying you 0.5%. That's the catch.

**Q: How liquid is this really?**
> Same-day liquidity. No lock-ups. Set a liquidity threshold and we'll never deploy below that amount. Need €100K for payroll tomorrow? One click. Done.

**Q: What's the risk?**
> DeFi protocols carry smart contract risk. We mitigate this by using only battle-tested protocols with $10B+ TVL and multiple audits.
>
> No investment is risk-free — we're transparent about that. But the protocols we use have secured billions for years. The question is whether the potential 14x improvement in yield is worth the calculated risk.

**Q: Will my CFO understand this?**
> Yes. We provide professional monthly statements, real-time dashboards, and board-ready reporting. No crypto jargon. Just clear numbers your finance team can work with.

**Q: How do you make money?**
> We take a 0.12% fee on yield earned. If you earn nothing, we earn nothing. Our incentives are aligned with yours.

**Q: What's the minimum?**
> We work with startups managing €50K+ in operating cash. Below that, the yield may not justify the setup time — we'll be honest about that.

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
> Most companies are fully onboarded within 48 hours. Setup itself takes about 15 minutes.

**Q: Is this legal/regulated?**
> Yes. We operate under the EU's MiCA framework with pending CASP authorization in Lithuania. We're building for compliance from day one.

## SECTION 8: THE PROCESS

**Header:**
> Getting started is simple

**Step 1:**
> **Book a call**
> 15 minutes. No pitch. Just an honest conversation about whether this makes sense for you.

**Step 2:**
> **Review the numbers**
> We'll show you exactly what your treasury could earn based on your cash position — and be honest about the risks.

**Step 3:**
> **Make a decision**
> If it makes sense, we'll help you set up. If it doesn't, no hard feelings. We'd rather you make the right choice than any choice.

**Step 4:**
> **Go live**
> Onboarding takes 48 hours. You'll see yield accruing from day one.

---

## SECTION 9: FINAL CTA

**Header:**
> Your bank is earning 7% with your money.
> Shouldn't you?

**Body:**
> 15 minutes. No pitch. Just an honest conversation about whether this makes sense for you.

**Primary CTA:**
> Book a conversation with Bar

**Alternative Contact:**
> Or email: bar@diboas.com

**Testimonial:**
> "I expected a sales pitch. Instead I got a thoughtful conversation about my actual situation. Bar told me this wasn't right for us yet — and explained why. That honesty made me trust them more. Six months later, we moved €300K."
> — Series A founder

## SECTION 10: MISSION FOOTER

**Header:**
> Why we do this

**Body:**
> The financial system is designed to keep ordinary people — and ordinary companies — from building wealth. Banks take your money, earn returns, and give you crumbs.
>
> We're building the alternative.
>
> Whether you're a grandmother saving for your family or a founder building the future, you deserve access to the same advantages the wealthy have always had.
>
> **Your money. Your future. Your rules.**

## RISK DISCLAIMER (Footer)

Smart contract risk exists with all DeFi protocols. Only allocate funds you can afford to have at risk. diBoaS does not provide investment advice.*
