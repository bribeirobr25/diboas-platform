      "question": "Do I need to know about crypto to use diBoaS?",
      "answer": "Not at all! Most of our users had never invested before.\n\nAqua was built specifically for complete beginners. It explains every term, every step, every decision.\n\nIt's like having a patient friend teaching you."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How much do I need to start?",
      "answer": "$10 is enough.\n\nSeriously. Ten dollars.\n\nThe idea is for you to start small, build confidence, and then increase when you feel comfortable."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How long does it take to open an account?",
      "answer": "Less than 5 minutes.\n\nYou'll need:\n- Social Security Number / Tax ID\n- Phone with camera (for selfie verification)\n- A valid email\n\nThat's it. No paperwork, no bureaucracy."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How do these guides work?",
      "answer": "They're AI assistants that observe how you use the app and reveal new features when you're ready.\n\nReal example:\n\nWeek 1: You only see Aqua. You make your first $10 investment.\n\nWeek 3: You've made 5 small investments and are exploring the app.\nMystic appears: \"Want to learn about stocks and ETFs?\"\n\nMonth 3: You have a diversified portfolio. Coral suggests: \"I see you understand risk. Want to explore high-yield DeFi?\"\n\nYou never see everything at once. Just what you need right now."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Will I always see all the guides?",
      "answer": "No! You start with just Aqua.\n\nMystic and Coral appear progressively as you're ready for more advanced features.\n\nThis prevents overwhelm while preserving sophistication."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I \"go back\" if something gets too complicated?",
      "answer": "Always.\n\nThere's a \"Simplify\" button on any screen. If you activated something and found it confusing, just turn it off.\n\nNo penalties, no questions asked."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Are the guides mandatory?",
      "answer": "No. You can use the app without them.\n\nBut 94% of our users prefer to keep the guides active because they really help prevent getting lost."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Is my money safe on diBoaS?",
      "answer": "Yes. Same security standards as major banks.\n\n- Non-custodial wallets (you own your assets)\n- Military-grade encryption\n- Compliance with Federal Reserve, MiCA (Europe), and SEC regulations\n- Audited by independent security firms\n\nIn 2024, we had ZERO cases of money loss due to security failures."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "What if diBoaS shuts down one day?",
      "answer": "You lose nothing.\n\nYour crypto stays in wallets that YOU control.\nYour traditional investments are held by regulated institutions.\n\nEven if we disappeared, you'd have full access to your funds."
    },
    "q10": {
      "question": "Can diBoaS touch my money?",
      "answer": "No. Technically impossible.\n\nThe guides give advice and recommendations. But every transaction requires YOUR password, YOUR biometrics, YOUR confirmation.\n\nWe have no way to move a penny without your authorization."
    },

      "question": "How much does it cost to use diBoaS?",

    "q6": {
      "question": "How much does my idle cash earn?",

    },
    "q23": {
      "question": "Do I need to understand crypto to start?",
      "answer": "Not at all!\n\nMost of our users had never bought crypto before.\n\nAqua guides you step by step:\n1. Explains what Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. are\n2.

    "q27": {
      "question": "Is Bitcoin a pyramid scheme/scam?",
      "answer": "No. But there are many scams USING Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is:\n- Legitimate technology (15 years operating)\n- Adopted by governments and companies\n- Transparent (all code is public)\n\nScams USE Bitcoin:\n- Promises of guaranteed returns\n- \"Double your Bitcoin\" schemes\n- Influencers selling shady courses\n\nCrypto A-Z teaches you to differentiate:\nWhat's real vs. what's a scam."
    },
    "q28": {
      "question": "Have I missed the boat on Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "Wrong question!\n\nNobody knows if Bitcoin will go up or down tomorrow.\n\nRight question:\n\"Does crypto make sense in my long-term portfolio?\"\n\nSmart strategy:\n- Start small ($10-50)\n- Buy regularly (every month)\n- Think in years, not days\n- Never more than 5-10% of total net worth\n\nDollar-cost averaging > trying to time the market."
    },
    "q29": {
      "question": "Which crypto should I buy first?",
      "answer": "For 99% of people:\n\n1st purchase: Bitcoin (BTC)\n- Most established\n- Most secure\n- Most liquid\n\n2nd purchase: Ethereum (ETH)\n- Second largest\n- Solid technology\n- Use case beyond \"currency\"\n\n3rd purchase: Stablecoin (USDC)\n- To hold value without volatility\n- To seize opportunities quickly\n\nOnly after mastering these 3, explore others.\nCrypto A-Z explains each in detail."
    },
    "q30": {
      "question": "What are these \"strategies\"?",
      "answer": "Think of them as \"smart piggy banks\" that grow your money.\n\nReal example:\n\nEmergency Fund Strategy:\n- You put in $500\n- diBoaS automatically invests in safe DeFi protocols\n- Earns ~8-12% annually\n- You can withdraw anytime\n\nIt's professional investing, simplified for anyone to use."
    },
    "q31": {
      "question": "Do I need to understand DeFi?",
      "answer": "Nope! That's the magic.\n\nDeFi (Decentralized Finance) is complex:\n- Protocols, pools, yields, farms...\n- 99% of people don't get it\n\ndiBoaS simplifies:\n- You choose \"I want to save for emergencies\"\n- We handle all the technical complexity\n- You just see: \"Earning 10.5% annually\"\n\nCoral explains what's happening, but you don't \nneed to understand to use it."
    },
    "q32": {
      "question": "How much do strategies earn?",
      "answer": "Varies, but we always show real-time rates:\n\nConservative Strategies (Mystic recommends):\n- Emergency Fund: 8-12% annually\n- Stable Growth: 10-15% annually\n\nModerate Strategies (Coral unlocks):\n- Balanced Yield: 15-25% annually\n- Growth Portfolio: 20-35% annually\n\nAggressive Strategies (advanced only):\n- High Yield: 35-80% annually (higher risk)\n\nFees: 0.09% to start + 0.09% to stop strategy."
    },
    "q33": {
      "question": "Can I lose money in strategies?",
      "answer": "Yes, all investments carry risk.\n\nBut we minimize it several ways:\n\n1. Gradual progression: Start with safe strategies only\n2. Auto-diversification: Your money goes to multiple protocols\n3. 24/7 monitoring: We detect issues before you do\n4. Insurance fund: Coverage for extreme cases\n\nRule: Aggressive strategies only appear when you've \ndemonstrated sufficient knowledge.\n\nCoral won't let you do something dumb."
    },
    "q34": {
      "question": "What is DeFi anyway?",
      "answer": "DeFi = Decentralized Finance\n\nIn plain English:\nDoing bank stuff (lending, investing, earning interest)\nwithout needing banks.\n\nReal example:\n\nTraditional bank:\n- You deposit $1,000\n- Bank pays 2% annually\n- Bank lends your money at 15% annually\n- Bank keeps the difference\n\nDeFi:\n- You lend directly to who needs it\n- Earn 8-15% annually\n- Protocol charges 0.09%\n- You keep the rest\n\nDeFi Explained decodes all of this."
    },
    "q35": {
      "question": "Is DeFi safe?",
      "answer": "Safer than it looks, less safe than it should be.\n\nTruths about DeFi security:\n\n✓ Main protocols constantly audited\n✓ Smart contracts are transparent (open source)\n✓ No intermediaries = fewer failure points\n\n✗ New protocols can have bugs\n✗ Hacks happen (but are decreasing)\n✗ Need to understand what you're doing\n\nHow diBoaS protects you:\n- Only uses audited and established protocols\n- Automatically diversifies\n- 24/7 risk monitoring\n- Insurance fund for extreme cases"
    },
    "q36": {
      "question": "Do I need to be a programmer to use DeFi?",
      "answer": "No! That's exactly why diBoaS exists.\n\nDeFi directly (without diBoaS):\n- Set up wallets\n- Understand gas fees\n- Interact with smart contracts\n- Monitor multiple protocols\n→ Complexity: Expert\n\nDeFi through diBoaS:\n- Choose \"I want 10% yield\"\n- Tap \"Start\"\n- Track in app\n→ Complexity: Beginner\n\nDeFi Explained teaches you what happens behind the scenes,\nbut you don't need to touch code."
    },
    "q37": {
      "question": "How does credit work on diBoaS?",
      "answer": "Fair credit, transparent, and under your control.\n\nAvailable types:\n\n1. Personal Credit: Unsecured, fast approval\n2. Secured Credit: Using your investments as collateral \n   (MUCH lower rates)\n3. Credit Line: Pre-approved limit, use when needed\n\nAll in-app, no branches or call centers needed."
    },
    "q38": {
      "question": "What interest rates do you charge?",
      "answer": "Depends on credit type and your profile:\n\nSecured Credit (cheapest):\n- With crypto/investments as collateral\n- 0.5% to 2% monthly\n- You keep earning on your investments\n\nPersonal Credit:\n- No collateral needed\n- 2% to 6% monthly\n- Faster approval\n\nWe always show APR (Annual Percentage Rate) before you approve.\nNo fine print."
    },
    "q39": {
      "question": "How do I increase my credit limit?",
      "answer": "Your limit evolves naturally with you:\n\nFactors that increase your limit:\n- On-time payment history\n- Time as customer\n- Investment volume on platform\n- Responsible credit use\n\nPro tip: \nSecured credit can be 5x larger than personal credit.\n\nExample: $1,000 in crypto = up to $5,000 secured limit."
    },
    "q40": {
      "question": "Is the Learn Center mandatory?",
      "answer": "Nope! But 94% of users love it.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- You CAN use the app without learning anything\n- But users who use Learn Center gain 3x more confidence\n- And make way better financial decisions\n\nIt's like having a financial university in your pocket.\nFree. At your pace. No tests."

      "answer": "Yes! And it actually means something.\n\nWhen you complete each module, you earn:\n- Badge on your profile\n- diBoaS points\n- Shareable digital certificate\n\nBut the best reward is different:\nConfidence to make financial decisions that change your life."
    },
    "q43": {
      "question": "Where do I start if I've never studied finance?",
      "answer": "Right here!\n\nFinancial Basics was built for people who've never seen this:\n\nModule 1: Budgeting (know where your money goes)\nModule 2: Emergencies (how to protect yourself)\nModule 3: Debt (how to get out of it)\nModule 4: Saving (how to start with $1)\n\nEach module includes:\n- 3-5 minute videos\n- Real-life examples\n- Practical exercises\n\nTotal: 2 hours of content worth years of learning."
    },
    "q44": {
      "question": "Does this work in my country?",
      "answer": "Yes! The principles are universal.\n\nWe adapt examples for:\n- USA ($, S&P 500, 401k)\n- Brazil (R$, CDI, Tesouro Direto)\n- Europe (€, EURIBOR, local funds)\n- Latin America (local currencies, inflation)\n\nFinancial math doesn't change.\nWe just adapt examples to your reality."
    },
    "q45": {
      "question": "How much will this cost me?",
      "answer": "$0. Zero. Nothing.\n\nFinancial Basics is completely free.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we believe financial education shouldn't be \na privilege for those who can afford $1,000 courses.\n\nDemocratization starts with accessible knowledge for everyone."
