        "question": "Do I need to know about crypto to use diBoaS?",
        "answer": "Not at all! Most of our users had never invested before.\n\nAqua was built specifically for complete beginners. It explains every term, every step, every decision.\n\nIt's like having a patient friend teaching you."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How much do I need to start?",
        "answer": "$10 is enough.\n\nSeriously. Ten dollars.\n\nThe idea is for you to start small, build confidence, and then increase when you feel comfortable."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How long does it take to open an account?",
        "answer": "Less than 5 minutes.\n\nYou'll need:\n- Social Security Number / Tax ID\n- Phone with camera (for selfie verification)\n- A valid email\n\nThat's it. No paperwork, no bureaucracy."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How do these guides work?",
        "answer": "They're AI assistants that observe how you use the app and reveal new features when you're ready.\n\nReal example:\n\nWeek 1: You only see Aqua. You make your first $10 investment.\n\nWeek 3: You've made 5 small investments and are exploring the app.\nMystic appears: \"Want to learn about stocks and ETFs?\"\n\nMonth 3: You have a diversified portfolio. Coral suggests: \"I see you understand risk. Want to explore high-yield DeFi?\"\n\nYou never see everything at once. Just what you need right now."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Will I always see all the guides?",
        "answer": "No! You start with just Aqua.\n\nMystic and Coral appear progressively as you're ready for more advanced features.\n\nThis prevents overwhelm while preserving sophistication."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Can I \"go back\" if something gets too complicated?",
        "answer": "Always.\n\nThere's a \"Simplify\" button on any screen. If you activated something and found it confusing, just turn it off.\n\nNo penalties, no questions asked."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Are the guides mandatory?",
        "answer": "No. You can use the app without them.\n\nBut 94% of our users prefer to keep the guides active because they really help prevent getting lost."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Is my money safe on diBoaS?",
        "answer": "Yes. Same security standards as major banks.\n\n- Non-custodial wallets (you own your assets)\n- Military-grade encryption\n- Compliance with Federal Reserve, MiCA (Europe), and SEC regulations\n- Audited by independent security firms\n\nIn 2024, we had ZERO cases of money loss due to security failures."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What if diBoaS shuts down one day?",
        "answer": "You lose nothing.\n\nYour crypto stays in wallets that YOU control.\nYour traditional investments are held by regulated institutions.\n\nEven if we disappeared, you'd have full access to your funds."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "Can diBoaS touch my money?",
        "answer": "No. Technically impossible.\n\nThe guides give advice and recommendations. But every transaction requires YOUR password, YOUR biometrics, YOUR confirmation.\n\nWe have no way to move a penny without your authorization."

      },
      "q13": {
        "question": "How do you make money then?",
        "answer": "Total transparency:\n\n1. Small transaction fee (that 0.09% and 0.9%)\n\n2. Content creators using our platform pay 0.9%\n   (much less than YouTube's 10%)\n\n3. Optional subscriptions for advanced features\n\nWe earn when you use it. Not when you just keep the account open."
