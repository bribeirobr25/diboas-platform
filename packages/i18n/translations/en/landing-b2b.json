No. Nothing is, including your bank.\n\nThe real question: Is 14x better returns worth a different risk profile? For some founders, yes. For others, no. Both are valid."

We provide the software that helps you deploy it to earning systems. But we never have access to move it ourselves.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- If diBoaS goes bankrupt, your money is still yours\n- No one at diBoaS can steal your funds\n- Every transaction requires your approval\n\nIt's a fundamentally different model. More control for you, less risk from us."
