No minimum balances.\n\nThe \"catch\" in your current setup? Your bank earns 7% with your money and pays you 0.5%. That €65,000 difference on €1M? That's their entire business model.\n\nNow you've seen the math."

Your money isn't committed.\n\nYou set the floor. \"Always keep €50K liquid\" — we only deploy what's above that.\n\nMost treasury tools make you choose: yield OR liquidity. We give you both."

        "question": "What's the actual risk?",
        "answer": "Let's be honest about this:\n\nAutomated system risk: The systems your money goes into are built on code. Code can have vulnerabilities.\n\nHow we mitigate:\n- Only systems with €10B+ in total value secured\n- Multiple independent security audits\n- Years of track record through market events\n- Your money spread across multiple independent systems\n\nZero risk? No. Nothing is — including your bank.\n\nThe real question: Is 14x better returns worth a different risk profile?\n\nFor some founders, yes. For others, no. Both are valid."

      "payments": {

Done.\n\nResult: Your freelancer in Buenos Aires gets paid in their local currency, same day, at the real exchange rate, for €0 in fees."

We make sure you're ready."

We just don't publish our exact strategy for competitors."
      },
      "whyCantTouch": {
        "question": "Why can't you touch my money?",
        "answer": "This is actually the whole point of how we're built.\n\nTraditional finance: You deposit money → it becomes the bank's money → they owe you a balance.\n\ndiBoaS: Your money stays in your own wallet. We provide the software that helps you deploy it to earning systems. But we never have access to move it ourselves.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- If diBoaS goes bankrupt, your money is still yours\n- No one at diBoaS can steal your funds\n- Every transaction requires your approval\n\nIt's a fundamentally different model. More control for you, less risk from us."
