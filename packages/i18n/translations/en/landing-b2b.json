If you earn €10,000, we keep €12.\n\nIf you earn nothing, we earn nothing.\n\nWhy structure it this way? It aligns our incentives with yours. We only succeed when you succeed.\n\nThe catch with your current bank? They're earning 7% on your money and paying you 0.5%. That spread is their business model."

      "liquidity": {
        "question": "How liquid is this really?",

No penalties.\n\nHere's how it works: you set a liquidity threshold — say, \"always keep €50K available.\" We only deploy cash above that threshold.\n\nNeed €100K for payroll tomorrow? One click. It's there.\n\nWe built it this way because treasury management shouldn't create new problems. You should be able to access your money when you need it."
      },
      "risk": {
        "question": "What's the risk?",
        "answer": "Let's be specific about risk, because this matters:\n\nSmart contract risk: DeFi protocols are code. Code can have bugs or be exploited. This is real.\n\nHow we mitigate it: We only use protocols with $10B+ in assets, multiple independent audits, and years of track record without major incidents.\n\nIs it zero risk? No. Nothing is.\n\nIs it riskier than your bank? Different. Banks have deposit insurance up to €100K. DeFi has transparency and non-custodial control.\n\nThe question is whether 14x better yield justifies the different risk profile. For some founders, yes. For others, no. Now you have the information to decide."

      "cfo": {
        "question": "Will my CFO/board understand this?",

Board-ready reporting without crypto jargon.\n\nYour CFO will see: deposits, yields, fees, withdrawals. Same categories they're used to.\n\nIf they want to dig deeper, we provide protocol documentation and audit reports. But they don't have to."
      },
      "revenue": {
        "question": "How do you make money?",
        "answer": "0.12% fee on yield earned. That's it.\n\nIf your treasury earns €35,000/year, we earn €42.\n\nIf you earn nothing, we earn nothing.\n\nNo hidden fees. No minimum balances. No lock-up penalties."
      },
      "minimum": {
        "question": "What's the minimum?",
        "answer": "€50K in operating cash.\n\nBelow that, the yield may not justify the setup time — we'll be honest about that. If you're earlier stage, keep us in mind for when you've raised more."
