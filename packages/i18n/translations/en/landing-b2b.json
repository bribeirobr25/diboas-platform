If you earn nothing and don't send money, we earn nothing. That's it. No hidden fees. No minimum balances. No catch."

        "question": "What's the actual risk?",
        "answer": "Let's be honest about this.\n\nAutomated system risk: The systems your money goes into are built on code. Code can have vulnerabilities.\n\nHow we reduce this:\n- Only systems with $10B+ in total value secured\n- Multiple independent security audits\n- Years of track record through market events\n- Your money spread across multiple independent systems\n\nZero risk? No. Nothing is, including your bank.\n\nThe real question: Is 14x better returns worth a different risk profile? For some founders, yes. For others, no. Both are valid."

Each step takes time and charges fees.\n\nWith diBoaS, payments go direct. Your wallet \u2192 their wallet. Done.\n\nResult: Your freelancer in Buenos Aires gets paid in their local currency, same day, at the real exchange rate, for just 0.12% in fees."

We make sure you're ready."

These are:\n- Established: Operating for 3+ years\n- Battle-tested: Survived multiple market crashes\n- Transparent: You can see exactly where your funds are at any time\n- Independently audited: Security verified by third parties\n\nOnce you're a customer, you'll see the full details of each system: names, track records, and why we chose them. We're happy to be transparent with customers. We just don't publish our exact strategy for competitors."

      "whyCantTouch": {
        "question": "Why can't you touch my money?",
        "answer": "This is actually the whole point of how we're built.\n\nTraditional finance: You deposit money \u2192 it becomes the bank's money \u2192 they owe you a balance.\n\ndiBoaS: Your money stays in your own wallet. We provide the software that helps you deploy it to earning systems. But we never have access to move it ourselves.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- If diBoaS goes bankrupt, your money is still yours\n- No one at diBoaS can steal your funds\n- Every transaction requires your approval\n\nIt's a fundamentally different model. More control for you, less risk from us."
