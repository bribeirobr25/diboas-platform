      "safety": {
        "question": "Is my money safe?",
        "answer": "Here's something most people don't know:\n\nWhen you put money in a bank, it's not technically \"yours\" anymore. Legally, it becomes the bank's money. They just owe you that amount back. That's how they can lend it out and invest it.\n\nWith diBoaS, it works differently. Your funds stay in your own wallet. We can't touch them. We just show you where to put them so they work harder.\n\nThe protocols we use (Aave, Compound) have secured billions of dollars for years. Are they the same as bank deposits? No. Are they the Wild West? Also no. They're somewhere in between, and now you know enough to decide for yourself."
      },
      "risks": {
        "question": "What are the risks?",
        "answer": "Let's talk about risk honestly:\n\nYour bank deposits feel safe because they're insured up to €100K. But the bank is taking risks with your money all the time. They just don't tell you.\n\nDeFi has different risks. Smart contracts are code, and code can have bugs. Protocols can be exploited.\n\nWe only use protocols that have secured $10B+ for years without major incidents. Is that zero risk? No. Is it more transparent than what banks do? Yes.\n\nStart with what you won't miss. Even €5. Learn how it works. Then decide if it's right for you."
      },
      "withdraw": {
        "question": "Can I withdraw anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes, and here's why that matters:\n\nMany \"high yield\" options lock your money. CDs. Bonds. Staking with lockup periods.\n\nWith diBoaS, your funds stay liquid. Request a withdrawal, get your money same day. No waiting periods. No penalties. No questions.\n\nBecause it's your money. You shouldn't need permission to use it."
      },
      "revenue": {
        "question": "How do you make money?",
        "answer": "We charge 0.9% when you withdraw. If you withdraw €100, we keep 90 cents.\n\nIf you don't withdraw, we don't earn anything.\n\nWe only make money when you make money."
      },
      "trust": {
        "question": "Why should I trust you?",
        "answer": "You shouldn't trust us because we ask you to. You should trust us because you can verify.\n\nYour money is in your wallet. You can check it anytime. The protocols are public. You can see exactly where it is. We're building under European regulation (MiCA). There's accountability.\n\nStart small. See how it works. Trust is earned."
      },
      "strategies": {
        "question": "What investment strategies do you offer?",
        "answer": "We offer 10 strategies across different goals and risk levels, from emergency funds to long-term wealth building.\n\nEach strategy is designed for a specific purpose: protecting your safety net, saving for short-term goals, or growing wealth over decades.",

      "crypto": {
        "question": "Do I need to know about crypto?",
        "answer": "No. You don't need to understand blockchain, wallets, or DeFi to use diBoaS.\n\nWe handle all the technical complexity. You just see your balance grow.\n\nThink of it like using email without understanding how internet protocols work. The technology is there, but you don't need to see it."
