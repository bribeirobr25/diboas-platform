They lend it out, invest it, and give you 0.5% for the privilege.\n\nWith diBoaS, your funds stay in your own non-custodial wallet. We can't touch your money. We just show you where to put it so it works harder for you.\n\nThe protocols we use (Aave, Compound) have secured billions of dollars and been battle-tested for years."
      },
      "risks": {
        "question": "What are the risks?",
        "answer": "Let's be honest: DeFi yields are not bank deposits. Smart contract risk exists. We only use battle-tested protocols with $10B+ in assets, but no investment is risk-free.\n\nThat's why we say: Start with what you won't miss. Even €5 is enough to begin."

      "withdraw": {
        "question": "Can I withdraw anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes. No lock-ups. No penalties. Your money is always accessible. Withdrawals typically complete same day.\n\nThis is your money. We believe you should always have access to it."

      "revenue": {
        "question": "How do you make money?",
        "answer": "We take a small fee (0.12%) when you earn. If you don't earn, we don't earn.\n\nOur success depends on your success. That's how it should be."
      },
      "crypto": {
        "question": "Do I need to understand crypto?",
        "answer": "No. We handle all the complexity. You just see your money growing. No wallets, no seed phrases, no confusing charts.\n\nThink of it like this: You don't need to know how a car engine works to drive. You just need to know it gets you where you're going."
      },
      "regulation": {
        "question": "Is this regulated?",
        "answer": "Yes. We operate under the EU's MiCA framework with planned CASP authorization. We only use protocols with over $10 billion in total value locked and multiple security audits.\n\nGerman thoroughness meets fair finance."
