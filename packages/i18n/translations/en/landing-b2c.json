        "question": "Is my money secure?",
        "answer": "Here's something most people don't know: When you put money in a bank, it's not technically \"yours\" anymore. Legally, it becomes the bank's money. They just promise to pay it back, while using it for their gains.\n\nWith diBoaS, it works differently. Your funds stay in your own wallet. We can't touch them. We just show you where to put them so your money works harder. These trusted systems have protected billions for years.\n\nAre they the same as bank deposits? No. Are they the Wild West? Also no. They're somewhere in between, and now you know enough to decide if it fits you."
      },
      "risks": {
        "question": "What risks should I know?",
        "answer": "Let's be real: Bank insurance covers up to $250K, but they risk your money behind the scenes without telling you.\n\ndiBoaS uses different tech code-based systems that could have glitches or attacks. We stick to proven ones ($10B+ protected, long track records).\n\nNo zero-risk anywhere, but this is clearer. Start with what you won't miss. Even $5. Learn how it works. Then decide if it's right for you."
      },
      "withdraw": {
        "question": "Can I get my money anytime?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. That's the point. Many high-growth options trap your funds for months.\n\nHere, it's always ready: request and receive same day, no penalties or questions.\n\nYour money, your call. You shouldn't need permission to use it."
      },
      "revenue": {
        "question": "How does diBoaS earn?",
        "answer": "We take 0.75% on withdrawals or transfers out, and 0.12% when closing positions or selling assets.\n\nFor $100 out, that's $0.75 to us. If you don't move it, we make zero.\n\nWe win only when you do."
      },
      "trust": {
        "question": "Why trust us?",
        "answer": "Don't just because we say so. Check for yourself.\n\nYour funds are in your wallet, visible anytime. The systems are open to verify. We focus on clear rules and accountability.\n\nTry with a little; build trust step by step."

        "question": "What strategies do you offer?",

      "crypto": {
        "question": "Do I need to know about crypto?",
        "answer": "No. You don't need to understand blockchain, wallets, or DeFi to use diBoaS.\n\nWe handle all the technical complexity. You just see your balance grow.\n\nThink of it like using email without understanding how internet protocols work. The technology is there, but you don't need to see it."
