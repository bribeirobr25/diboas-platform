      "safety": {
        "question": "Is my money safe?",
        "answer": "Here's something interesting most people don't know:\n\nWhen you put money in a bank, it's not technically \"yours\" anymore. Legally, it becomes the bank's money — they just owe you that amount back. That's how they can lend it out and invest it.\n\nWith diBoaS, it works differently. Your funds stay in your own wallet. We can't touch them. We just show you where to put them so they work harder.\n\nThe protocols we use (Aave, Compound) have secured billions of dollars for years. Are they the same as bank deposits? No. Are they the Wild West? Also no. They're somewhere in between — and now you know enough to decide for yourself."
      },
      "risks": {
        "question": "What are the risks?",
        "answer": "Let's talk about risk honestly, because this is important:\n\nYour bank deposits feel safe because they're insured up to €100K. But here's what that means: the government promises to pay you back if the bank fails. The bank itself is taking risks with your money all the time.\n\nDeFi has different risks. Smart contracts are code — and code can have bugs. Protocols can be exploited.\n\nHere's how we think about it: we only use protocols that have secured $10B+ for years without major incidents. Is that zero risk? No. Is it more transparent than what banks do with your money? Yes.\n\nStart with what you won't miss. Even €5. Learn how it works. Then decide if it's right for you."
      },
      "withdraw": {
        "question": "Can I withdraw anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes — and here's why that matters:\n\nMost investments that pay higher returns lock your money up. CDs, bonds, even some savings accounts have penalties for early withdrawal. The trade-off is: higher returns, less access.\n\nWe built diBoaS differently. Same-day withdrawals. No lock-ups. No penalties.\n\nWhy? Because we believe your money should be accessible to you. Always. If you need it for an emergency tomorrow, it's there."
      },
      "revenue": {
        "question": "How do you make money?",
        "answer": "Transparency matters, so here's exactly how it works:\n\nWe take a small fee (0.12%) when you earn. If you earn €10 in a month, we keep about 1.2 cents.\n\nIf you earn nothing, we earn nothing.\n\nThis is intentional. It means we only succeed when you succeed. Our incentives are aligned with yours — not against you, like traditional banks whose profit often comes from your inactivity."
      },
      "crypto": {
        "question": "Do I need to understand crypto?",
        "answer": "No — and here's why:\n\nUnder the hood, diBoaS uses DeFi protocols. That sounds technical, but you don't need to understand how it works any more than you need to understand how Visa processes your card payment.\n\nYou won't see blockchain addresses or seed phrases. You'll see your balance. Your earnings. A withdraw button.\n\nWe handle the complexity. You get the results.\n\nThat said, if you *want* to learn how it works, we have resources for that too. Education is part of what we do."
      },
      "trust": {
        "question": "Why should I trust you?",
        "answer": "Fair question. Here's how I think about trust:\n\nYou shouldn't trust us because we ask you to. You should trust us because you can verify what we do.\n\nYour funds are in your own wallet — you can check anytime. The protocols we use are public — you can see exactly where your money goes. We're building under EU regulation (MiCA) — there's accountability.\n\nStart small. Watch how it works. Trust builds from there."
      },
      "regulation": {
        "question": "Is this regulated?",
        "answer": "Yes. We operate under the EU's MiCA framework with planned CASP authorization. We only use protocols with over $10 billion in total value locked and multiple security audits.\n\nGerman thoroughness meets fair finance."
      },
      "pix": {
        "question": "Does it work with PIX?",
        "answer": "Yes! Deposits and withdrawals via PIX. Simple as that."
