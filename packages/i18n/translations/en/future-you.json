        "question": "Is 8% realistic?",
        "answer": "The 8% is in the middle of our Safe Harbor strategy's expected range (6-10% per year). We tested this strategy across 4 years of real market data, including the 2022 crash and multiple smaller drops.\n\nIs it guaranteed going forward? No. Could it be higher or lower? Yes. But it's grounded in real data, not wishful thinking.\n\nWe use 8% instead of 10% to be conservative. We'd rather you be pleasantly surprised than disappointed."
      },
      "bankRate": {
        "question": "Why do you use 0.4% for banks?",
        "answer": "That's the average savings account rate in the US. Some banks pay more during promotional periods (maybe 1-2%), most pay less or even nothing. We use the average because that's what most people actually get.\n\nIf your bank pays more, great! But even at 2%, the gap between what you're earning and what's possible is still enormous."
      },
      "inflation": {
        "question": "What about inflation?",
        "answer": "This calculator shows the actual numbers, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nHere's why that matters:\n- At 0.4%, you're almost certainly losing purchasing power every year. Inflation eats more than you earn.\n- At 8%, you're likely beating inflation and building real wealth.\n\nThe exact impact depends on future inflation, which nobody can predict. But earning 8% puts you in a much stronger position than earning 0.4%."
      },
      "minimum": {
        "question": "Can I really start with {currency}5/month?",
        "answer": "Yes. diBoaS has no minimum beyond {currency}5.\n\nWe believe everyone should have access to real returns, not just people with thousands to invest.\n\n{currency}5/month for 20 years at 8% = ~{currency}2,945\nThat's ~{currency}1,745 in earnings on {currency}1,200 deposited.\n\nSmall? Maybe. But it's {currency}1,745 more than you'd have doing nothing."
      },
      "inconsistent": {
        "question": "What if I can't save the same amount every month?",
        "answer": "Life happens. You can adjust anytime.\n\nThis calculator assumes consistent monthly amounts because that's the easiest way to project. But diBoaS doesn't require consistency.\n\nSome months you save {currency}200. Some months {currency}20. Some months {currency}0. The math still works — just differently. What matters is that you start."
      },
      "whichStrategy": {
        "question": "Which strategy should I actually use?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses Safe Harbor as a baseline because it's:\n- Our most conservative strategy\n- Uses only stable systems (no price swing exposure)\n- Never lost money in our 4-year test\n\nIf you're comfortable with occasional dips and have a longer timeframe, strategies with growth potential might suit you better."
      },
      "bankDifference": {
        "question": "How is this different from my bank's savings account?",
        "answer": "Three main differences:\n\n1. Returns: Banks typically pay 0.4% or less. Our most conservative strategy targets 6-10%.\n\n2. Where your money goes: Banks lend your money out and keep most of the returns. With diBoaS, your money goes into systems that pay you directly.\n\n3. Control: Bank deposits become the bank's money (legally, they just owe you). With diBoaS, your money stays in your own wallet. We can't touch it.\n\nThe tradeoff? Bank deposits are insured up to {currency}100,000. diBoaS deposits are not insured, though the systems we use have secured billions safely for years."
