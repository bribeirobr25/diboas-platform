## SECTION 1: HERO

**Headline:**
> Find the strategy that fits your life

**Subheadline:**
> 10 strategies. Different goals. Different timelines. Different risk levels.
>
> No strategy is "best." The best one is the one that matches where you are and where you're going.

**Trust Line:**
> All strategies use solid systems that have secured billions for years. We tested them across 4 years of real market data — bull and bear markets, crashes and recoveries, and everything in between.

## SECTION 2: STRATEGY MATRIX

**Header:**
> Choose your path

**Instructions:**

| **Short-Term** (< 2 years) | Goal Keeper | Steady Progress |

## SECTION 3: STRATEGY CARDS

### STRATEGY 1: Safe Harbor

**Badge:** Stable Returns | Emergency Fund

**Tagline:**
> Your safety net that actually grows

**Description:**
> This is where you keep money you might need tomorrow. It needs to be there when you need it. No surprises.
>
> Safe Harbor uses only stable digital dollars. No exposure to digital asset prices. Your €1,000 stays close to €1,000 while earning returns.

**Allocation:**
> 50% System A + 30% System B + 20% System C
>
> Your money is distributed across multiple independent systems to reduce risk. Each system has secured billions of dollars for years.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

**What could happen (based on thousands of simulations):**

| | |
|--|--|
| **Chance of losing money** | Less than 1% |
| **Typical annual return** | 6-10% per year |
| **How bumpy is the ride?** | Very smooth. Your balance stayed stable throughout our 4-year test. |

**Best For:**
> People building their first emergency fund. Anyone who wants to learn how this works without price swings.

**Risk Level:**

---

### STRATEGY 2: Stable Growth

**Badge:** Growth Potential (30%) | Emergency Fund

**Tagline:**
> Emergency fund with upside potential

**Description:**
> Same purpose as Safe Harbor, but with 30% exposure to digital asset growth. You're accepting some price movement for higher potential returns.
>
> This works for people who already have a stable emergency fund and want their second layer to work harder.

**Allocation:**
> 70% System A + 30% System D
>
> Most of your money stays in stable digital dollars. A smaller portion participates in digital asset growth.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Chance of losing money** | Around 5% |

**Best For:**
> People comfortable with some price movement who want their safety net to capture growth potential.

**Risk Level:**
> Low — 30% of your balance will move with digital asset prices. Expect occasional dips.

**Note:**
> Not for your primary emergency fund. Build Safe Harbor first.

---

### STRATEGY 3: Goal Keeper

**Badge:** Stable Returns | Short-Term

**Tagline:**
> Protecting your near-term dreams

**Description:**
> Saving for something in the next 2 years? A trip, a wedding, a car? This keeps every euro working toward your deadline without risking it.

### STRATEGY 4: Steady Progress

**Badge:** Growth Potential (35%) | Short-Term

**Tagline:**
> Short-term goals with growth potential

**Description:**
> You have a goal in the next 2 years, but you're okay with some price movement if it means higher returns. 35% growth exposure gives you upside while keeping most of your money stable.

>
> The majority stays stable. A portion participates in digital asset growth.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

---

### STRATEGY 5: Patient Builder

**Badge:** Stable Returns | Medium-Term

**Tagline:**
> Steady growth for the patient investor

**Description:**
> You're thinking 2-5 years out. Maybe a down payment, maybe starting a business. You want consistent growth without watching prices jump around.

**Allocation:**
> 50% System A + 30% System B + 20% System C
>
> Distributed across stable systems for consistent returns.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

**Risk Level:**
> Medium — 40% growth exposure means meaningful swings in both directions.

---

### STRATEGY 7: Steady Compounder

**Badge:** Stable Returns | Long-Term

**Tagline:**
> Let time do the heavy lifting

**Description:**
> You're playing the long game. 5-10 years. You don't need to take big risks because you have time on your side. Consistent returns at 6-10% over a decade is powerful.

**Allocation:**
> 55% System A + 30% System B + 15% System C
>
> Optimized for long-term compounding with minimal volatility.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

---

### STRATEGY 8: Wealth Accelerator

**Badge:** Growth Potential (70%) | Long-Term

**Tagline:**
> For believers who've done the research

**Description:**
> This is not for everyone. 70% growth exposure means your portfolio will move significantly with digital asset prices. But over long time horizons, digital assets have historically delivered strong returns.
>
> You need to be able to watch your balance drop 40%+ and not panic.

**Allocation:**
> 30% System A + 35% System D + 35% System E
>
> Tilted heavily toward growth potential.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

**What could happen (based on thousands of simulations):**

| | |
|--|--|
| **Chance of losing money** | Around 24% |
| **Typical annual return** | Highly variable — could be negative or exceed 50% |
| **How bumpy is the ride?** | Big swings. At worst, your balance dropped 47% before recovering. You need to be comfortable watching your balance temporarily halve. |

**Best For:**
> Long-term believers who can stomach extreme volatility for potentially higher returns.

**Risk Level:**
> High — Significant chance of meaningful losses in shorter timeframes. Only for money you won't need for 5+ years.

**Warning:**
> Your outcomes could range from -60% to +200%+. Only for users who can tolerate significant losses.

---

### STRATEGY 9: Yield Maximizer

**Badge:** Stable Returns | Wealth Building

**Tagline:**
> Maximum returns, minimum volatility

**Description:**
> You want the highest stable returns over 10+ years without exposure to digital asset prices. This optimizes for returns across the safest systems.

**Allocation:**
> 45% System A + 35% System B + 20% System C
>
> Our highest-returning stable-only configuration.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

| | |
|--|--|

**Risk Level:**
> Minimal — Our highest-yielding stable strategy.

---

### STRATEGY 10: Full Throttle

**Badge:** Growth Potential (85%) | Wealth Building

**Tagline:**
> Maximum risk. Maximum potential.

**Description:**
> This is our most aggressive strategy. 85% growth exposure. Designed for a small portion of your portfolio that you're willing to lose entirely.
>
> The upside? In rare scenarios, returns have exceeded 1,000%.
>
> The downside? 27% probability of loss. Your balance dropped 66% at its worst point in our test.

**Allocation:**
> 15% System A + 30% System D + 35% System E + 20% System F
>
> Maximum growth exposure with minimal stability buffer.
>
> *[Full details available after joining]*

**What could happen (based on thousands of simulations):**

| | |
|--|--|
| **Chance of losing money** | Around 27% |
| **Typical annual return** | Extremely variable — from large losses to extraordinary gains |
| **How bumpy is the ride?** | Roller coaster. At worst, your balance dropped 66% before recovering. Only for those who can stomach near-total temporary losses. |

**Access Requirements:**
> - Account age: 6+ months
> - Minimum balance: €1,000
> - Maximum allocation: 20% of your total portfolio
> - 24-hour waiting period before activation
> - Risk acknowledgment required

**Best For:**
> Experienced investors with high risk tolerance allocating a small portion of their portfolio.

**Risk Level:**
> Very High — Near-total loss possible. Only use what you can afford to lose completely.

**Warning:**
> This isn't safe. It's for those who understand that. You could lose 78% or gain extraordinarily. Never put money here that you need.

## SECTION 4: HOW TO CHOOSE

**Header:**
> Not sure where to start?

**Body:**
> Here's a simple framework:

**Question 1: What's this money for?**
> - Emergency fund → Safe Harbor or Stable Growth
> - Something in the next 2 years → Goal Keeper or Steady Progress
> - Something in 2-5 years → Patient Builder or Balanced Builder
> - Long-term wealth → Steady Compounder, Wealth Accelerator, Yield Maximizer, or Full Throttle

**Question 2: How do you feel about price swings?**
> - "I don't want any" → Stick to the Stable Returns column
> - "I understand them and can wait out dips" → Consider the Growth Potential column
> - "I'm not sure" → Start stable. Learn. You can always add growth exposure later.

**Question 3: What would you do if your balance dropped 20%?**
> - "I'd panic and withdraw" → Stable Returns strategies only
> - "I'd wait for it to recover" → Low-medium growth strategies
> - "I'd add more money" → You might be ready for higher growth exposure

**Golden Rule:**
> When in doubt, start conservative. You can always move up the risk spectrum. You can't undo losses from strategies you weren't ready for.

---

## SECTION 5: FAQ

**Header:**
> Questions about strategies

---

**Q: Can I switch strategies?**

> Yes, anytime. No penalties. No questions asked.
>
> Here's something to keep in mind though: if you switch during a market dip, you might lock in a temporary loss. It's like selling your house during a recession — you get less than it's worth.
>
> The best time to switch is when your GOALS change, not when the market moves. If you went from "saving for a car" to "saving for retirement," that's a good reason to switch. If you're switching because prices dropped last week, that's usually the wrong call.

---

**Q: Can I use multiple strategies at once?**

> Absolutely. Many people do.
>
> Think of it like having different accounts for different purposes:
> - Emergency fund in Safe Harbor
> - Vacation savings in Goal Keeper  
> - Long-term wealth in Balanced Builder
>
> You're building your own portfolio of strategies. Each one serves a different part of your financial life.

---

**Q: How does rebalancing work?**

> When market movements push your allocation off target (more than 10% drift), we'll notify you.
>
> You'll see exactly what changed and why. Then you decide: approve the rebalance, or leave it as is.
>
> We never move your money without your approval. Your funds, your control. Always.
>
> Why does this matter? Some platforms move your money automatically. We don't. We can't. Your money stays in your own wallet, and only you can authorize changes.

---

**Q: Are these returns guaranteed?**

> No. And anyone who guarantees returns is lying to you.
>
> What we can tell you:
> - We tested every strategy across 4 years of real market data
> - This included the 2022 crash, multiple smaller crashes, and recovery periods
> - The numbers we show are based on what actually happened and thousands of simulations of what could happen
>
> Will the future look exactly like the past? No. Could returns be higher or lower? Yes. But our projections are grounded in real data, not wishful thinking.
>
> Start with what you can afford to learn with.

---

**Q: What if one of the systems has a problem?**

> This is a real risk. Automated systems are built on code, and code can have vulnerabilities.
>
> We reduce this risk by:
> - Only using systems that have secured $10B+ for years without major incidents
> - Spreading your money across multiple independent systems
> - Monitoring for unusual activity 24/7
> - Never putting all your eggs in one basket
>
> Is the risk zero? No. Is it transparent? Yes. You always know exactly where your money is.

---

**Q: Why are there extra requirements for Full Throttle?**

> Because we want to protect you from yourself.
>
> Full Throttle can lose most of its value. We've seen people make impulsive decisions with aggressive strategies and regret them deeply.
>
> The requirements (6 months account history, €1,000 minimum, 24-hour waiting period) aren't there to exclude you. They're there to make sure you've thought it through.
>
> If you're truly ready, these requirements won't stop you. If you're not ready, they might save you from a painful lesson.

---

**Q: What systems do you actually use?**

> We partner with established systems that have:
> - Operated for years without major security incidents
> - Secured billions of dollars
> - Been audited by independent security firms
> - Transparent operations you can verify yourself
>
> Once you join and log in, you'll see the full details of each system, including their names, track records, and why we chose them.
>
> Why don't we show this publicly? Because the specific combination of systems and allocations is part of what makes diBoaS unique. We're happy to be fully transparent with our users — just not with competitors.

### STRATEGIE 1: Safe Harbor

**Badge:** Stabile Renditen | Notgroschen

**Tagline:**
> Ihr Sicherheitsnetz, das tatsächlich wächst

**Description:**
> Hier bewahren Sie Geld auf, das Sie möglicherweise morgen brauchen. Es muss da sein, wenn Sie es brauchen. Keine Überraschungen.

**Geeignet für:**
> Menschen, die ihren ersten Notgroschen aufbauen. Alle, die verstehen möchten, wie das funktioniert, ohne Preisschwankungen.

**Risikostufe:**

**Geeignet für:**
> Menschen, die verstehen, dass Preise steigen UND fallen, und die durch vorübergehende Einbrüche halten können.

**Risikostufe:**

---

### STRATEGIE 10: Full Throttle

**Badge:** Wachstumspotenzial (85%) | Vermögensaufbau

**Tagline:**
> Maximales Risiko. Maximales Potenzial.

**Description:**
> Dies ist unsere aggressivste Strategie. 85% Wachstumsexposition. Konzipiert für einen kleinen Teil Ihres Portfolios, den Sie bereit sind, vollständig zu verlieren.

## SECTION 5: FAQ

**Header:**
> Fragen zu Strategien

---

**Q: Kann ich die Strategie wechseln?**

> Ja, jederzeit. Keine Strafen. Keine Fragen.
>
> Bedenken Sie jedoch: Wenn Sie während eines Markteinbruchs wechseln, könnten Sie einen vorübergehenden Verlust festschreiben. Es ist wie ein Hausverkauf während einer Rezession — Sie bekommen weniger als es wert ist.
>
> Der beste Zeitpunkt zum Wechseln ist, wenn sich Ihre ZIELE ändern, nicht wenn sich der Markt bewegt. Wenn Sie von "Sparen für ein Auto" zu "Sparen für die Rente" gewechselt sind, ist das ein guter Grund. Wenn Sie wechseln, weil die Preise letzte Woche gefallen sind, ist das meist die falsche Entscheidung.

---

**Q: Wie funktioniert die Neugewichtung?**

> Wenn Marktbewegungen Ihre Allokation vom Ziel abdriften lassen (mehr als 10% Abweichung), benachrichtigen wir Sie.
>
> Sie sehen genau, was sich geändert hat und warum. Dann entscheiden Sie: Neugewichtung genehmigen oder so lassen, wie es ist.
>
> Wir bewegen Ihr Geld niemals ohne Ihre Genehmigung. Ihre Mittel, Ihre Kontrolle. Immer.
>
> Warum ist das wichtig? Einige Plattformen bewegen Ihr Geld automatisch. Wir nicht. Wir können es nicht. Ihr Geld bleibt in Ihrer eigenen Wallet, und nur Sie können Änderungen autorisieren.

---

**Q: Sind diese Renditen garantiert?**

> Nein. Und jeder, der Renditen garantiert, lügt Sie an.
>
> Was wir Ihnen sagen können:
> - Wir haben jede Strategie über 4 Jahre echter Marktdaten getestet
> - Dies umfasste den Crash von 2022, mehrere kleinere Crashs und Erholungsphasen
> - Die Zahlen, die wir zeigen, basieren auf dem, was tatsächlich passiert ist, und tausenden Simulationen dessen, was passieren könnte
>
> Wird die Zukunft genau wie die Vergangenheit aussehen? Nein. Könnten die Renditen höher oder niedriger sein? Ja. Aber unsere Projektionen basieren auf echten Daten, nicht auf Wunschdenken.

## SECTION 5: FAQ

**Header:**
> Perguntas sobre estratégias

---

**Q: Posso trocar de estratégia?**

> Pode, a qualquer hora. Sem multa. Sem pergunta.
>
> Mas olha só: se você trocar durante uma queda do mercado, pode acabar travando uma perda temporária. É como vender sua casa durante uma recessão — você recebe menos do que vale.
>
> O melhor momento pra trocar é quando seus OBJETIVOS mudam, não quando o mercado se move. Se você foi de "guardar pro carro" pra "guardar pra aposentadoria," isso é um bom motivo. Se você tá trocando porque os preços caíram semana passada, geralmente é a decisão errada.

---

**Q: Como funciona o rebalanceamento?**

> Quando movimentos do mercado empurram sua alocação pra longe do alvo (mais de 10% de desvio), a gente te notifica.
>
> Você vai ver exatamente o que mudou e por quê. Aí você decide: aprova o rebalanceamento, ou deixa como tá.
>
> A gente nunca move seu dinheiro sem sua aprovação. Seus fundos, seu controle. Sempre.
>
> Por que isso importa? Algumas plataformas movem seu dinheiro automaticamente. A gente não. A gente não consegue. Seu dinheiro fica na sua própria carteira, e só você pode autorizar mudanças.

---

**Q: Esses retornos são garantidos?**

> Não. E qualquer um que garante retornos tá mentindo pra você.
>
> O que a gente pode te dizer:
> - A gente testou cada estratégia em 4 anos de dados reais do mercado
> - Isso incluiu o crash de 2022, vários crashes menores e períodos de recuperação
> - Os números que a gente mostra são baseados no que realmente aconteceu e em milhares de simulações do que poderia acontecer
>
> O futuro vai ser exatamente igual ao passado? Não. Os retornos podem ser maiores ou menores? Podem. Mas nossas projeções são baseadas em dados reais, não em pensamento positivo.

Seu dinheiro é colocado em sistemas automatizados que carregam risco técnico, risco de mercado e risco de liquidez. Estratégias de crescimento envolvem risco adicional de volatilidade de preço.

## SECTION 5: FAQ

**Header:**
> Preguntas sobre estrategias

---

**Q: ¿Puedo cambiar de estrategia?**

> Sí, en cualquier momento. Sin penalidades. Sin preguntas.
>
> Pero ten en cuenta: si cambias durante una caída del mercado, podrías fijar una pérdida temporal. Es como vender tu casa durante una recesión — recibes menos de lo que vale.
>
> El mejor momento para cambiar es cuando tus OBJETIVOS cambian, no cuando el mercado se mueve. Si pasaste de "ahorrar para un carro" a "ahorrar para la jubilación," esa es una buena razón. Si estás cambiando porque los precios cayeron la semana pasada, generalmente es la decisión equivocada.

---

**Q: ¿Cómo funciona el rebalanceo?**

> Cuando los movimientos del mercado empujan tu asignación fuera del objetivo (más del 10% de desviación), te notificamos.
>
> Verás exactamente qué cambió y por qué. Luego decides: aprobar el rebalanceo, o dejarlo como está.
>
> Nunca movemos tu dinero sin tu aprobación. Tus fondos, tu control. Siempre.
>
> ¿Por qué importa esto? Algunas plataformas mueven tu dinero automáticamente. Nosotros no. No podemos. Tu dinero permanece en tu propia billetera, y solo tú puedes autorizar cambios.

---

**Q: ¿Estos rendimientos están garantizados?**

> No. Y cualquiera que garantice rendimientos te está mintiendo.
>
> Lo que podemos decirte:
> - Probamos cada estrategia en 4 años de datos reales del mercado
> - Esto incluyó el crash de 2022, varias caídas menores y períodos de recuperación
> - Los números que mostramos se basan en lo que realmente pasó y miles de simulaciones de lo que podría pasar
>
> ¿El futuro será exactamente como el pasado? No. ¿Los rendimientos podrían ser mayores o menores? Sí. Pero nuestras proyecciones se basan en datos reales, no en ilusiones.
