### Origin Story Section

**Header:** Because of my grandmother

**Body:**
My grandmother taught me to save. She said I should try to save half of everything I earn. She tried that herself. Her whole life.

Work hard. Buy only the basics. Try to save.

It still didn't work.

Sounds familiar?

Here's what no one told her: Her bank paid her 0.5% interest while earning 7% with her money.

Think about it. That €1,000 you saved? The bank made €70 with it and gave you €5 back. The other €65? That was supposed to be yours.

The same bank is doing that with all of us.

That's why I'm building diBoaS.

### FAQ Section

**Header:** Things worth knowing

**Description:** Get answers to the most common questions about diBoaS.

**CTA Text:** Join the waitlist

#### Q: Is my money safe?
Here's something most people don't know:

When you put money in a bank, it's not technically "yours" anymore. Legally, it becomes the bank's money. They just owe you that amount back. That's how they can lend it out and invest it.

With diBoaS, it works differently. Your funds stay in your own wallet. We can't touch them. We just show you where to put them so they work harder.

The protocols we use (Aave, Compound) have secured billions of dollars for years. Are they the same as bank deposits? No. Are they the Wild West? Also no. They're somewhere in between, and now you know enough to decide for yourself.

#### Q: What are the risks?
Let's talk about risk honestly:

Your bank deposits feel safe because they're insured up to €100K. But the bank is taking risks with your money all the time. They just don't tell you.

DeFi has different risks. Smart contracts are code, and code can have bugs. Protocols can be exploited.

We only use protocols that have secured $10B+ for years without major incidents. Is that zero risk? No. Is it more transparent than what banks do? Yes.

Start with what you won't miss. Even €5. Learn how it works. Then decide if it's right for you.

#### Q: Can I withdraw anytime?
Yes, and here's why that matters:

Many "high yield" options lock your money. CDs. Bonds. Staking with lockup periods.

With diBoaS, your funds stay liquid. Request a withdrawal, get your money same day. No waiting periods. No penalties. No questions.

Because it's your money. You shouldn't need permission to use it.

#### Q: How do you make money?
We charge 0.9% when you withdraw. If you withdraw €100, we keep 90 cents.

If you don't withdraw, we don't earn anything.

We only make money when you make money.

#### Q: Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't trust us because we ask you to. You should trust us because you can verify.

Your money is in your wallet. You can check it anytime. The protocols are public. You can see exactly where it is. We're building under European regulation (MiCA). There's accountability.

Start small. See how it works. Trust is earned.

#### Q: What investment strategies do you offer?
We offer 10 strategies across different goals and risk levels, from emergency funds to long-term wealth building.

Each strategy is designed for a specific purpose: protecting your safety net, saving for short-term goals, or growing wealth over decades.

**Link:** Explore all strategies

#### Q: Do I need to know about crypto?
No. You don't need to understand blockchain, wallets, or DeFi to use diBoaS.

We handle all the technical complexity. You just see your balance grow.

Think of it like using email without understanding how internet protocols work. The technology is there, but you don't need to see it.

## B2B Landing Page

- Your bank invests your treasury.
- Earns millions.
- Gives you nothing.

**Full Headline:**
Your bank invests your treasury. Earns millions. Gives you nothing.

**Subheadline:**
On €500K, that's €35,000/year sitting on the table. While they charge you fees for the privilege.

### The Math Section

**Header:** The math nobody shows you

**Intro:**
You raised €2M. You'll spend it over 18 months. That means €1M+ sits in your account at any given time.

Here's what's happening with that money:

**Comparison Table:**

| Metric | Your Bank | With diBoaS |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Your balance | €1,000,000 | €1,000,000 |
| What they earn with it | €70,000/year | — |
| What you earn | €5,000/year | €70,000/year |
| The difference | They keep €65,000 | You keep €65,000 |

**Insight:** That €65,000 is runway. It's an extra hire. It's six more months to find product-market fit.

**Question:** Do you want it, or are you okay with them keeping it?

**CTA:** Calculate your numbers →

### Origin Story Section

**Header:** Because of my grandmother

**Body:**
My grandmother taught me to save. She said I should try to save half of everything I earn. She did that herself. Her whole life.

She tried everything. Work hard. Buy only the basics. Try to save.

It still didn't work.

Sounds familiar?

Here's what no one told her: Her bank paid her 0.5% interest while earning 7% — with her money.

The same bank is doing that with all of us. Including your startup.

That €1,000 she saved? The bank made €70 with it and gave her €5 back. The other €65? That was supposed to be hers.

The same thing is happening to your treasury right now.

My grandmother couldn't access better rates. The system wasn't built for people like her.

But founders? You have options. You just need to know they exist.

That's why I'm building diBoaS.

**Signature:** — Bar, Founder

### Calculator Section

**Header:** Let's look at your numbers

**Fields:**

- Current interest rate
- What your bank earns with it
- What your bank pays you
- What diBoaS would pay you
- The difference

**Defaults:**
- Cash on hand: €500,000

**Insight:**
That €32,500 is runway. That's real money — not theoretical.

Yours if you want it.

**CTA:** Let's talk about this →

### How It Works Section

**Header:** How it works

**Step 1: Connect**
Link your business account. 2-minute setup. No technical integration needed.

**Step 2: Set your floor**
Tell us your liquidity threshold — "always keep €50K available." We only deploy above that. You're never caught short.

**Step 3: Earn**
Cash above your threshold earns 6-8% annual return through proven institutional systems. Same rates banks earn — now yours.

**Step 4: Withdraw**
Need cash? One click. Same-day settlement. No lock-ups. No penalties. No questions.

**Footer:** Monthly statements. Board-ready reporting. Plain language — no jargon.

### Features Section

**Header:** More than yield. Everything your treasury needs.

**Intro:** Yield is the headline. But these might matter even more to your business.

#### Feature 1: Instant Payments
- **Headline:** Pay anyone. Instantly. Zero fees.
- **Body:** Paying contractors in Argentina? A vendor in Germany? A freelancer in Singapore?

  Traditional wires: €25-50 per transaction. 2-5 business days. Exchange rate markup.

  With diBoaS: €0 fees. Settled in seconds. Real exchange rate.
- **Before:** €500 wire to contractor = €475 received (after fees + spread)
- **After:** €500 sent = €500 received

#### Feature 2: Receive Payments
- **Headline:** Get paid faster. Keep more.
- **Body:** Your customers can pay you instantly — from anywhere in the world. No payment processor taking 2.9% + €0.30. No waiting 3-5 days for settlement.
- **Before:** €10,000 invoice → €9,700 after Stripe fees → available in 3 days
- **After:** €10,000 invoice → €10,000 received → available immediately

#### Feature 3: Cashflow Optimization
- **Headline:** Your cash works 24/7. Even when you don't.
- **Body:** Most business accounts pay nothing overnight. Your €500K just... sits there.

  With diBoaS, idle cash earns returns continuously. Every hour. Every day. Including weekends and holidays.
- **Example (€500K overnight for 30 days):**
  - Bank: €0-20
  - diBoaS: ~€2,500

#### Feature 4: Overnight Sweep
- **Headline:** Automatic overnight optimization
- **Body:** End of business day, your cash automatically moves to yield-generating systems. Start of business day, it's back and liquid.

  You set the floor. We handle the rest.
- **Schedule:**
  - 6 PM: Cash above threshold → earning systems
  - 9 AM: Full liquidity restored
  - You: Do nothing

#### Your Funds, Your Wallet
- **Title:** Your Funds, Your Wallet

#### Independently Audited
- **Title:** Independently Audited

### Fit Assessment Section

**Header:** Honest fit assessment

#### Good Fit:
- €50K+ in operating cash
- 12-24 month runway you're spending down over time
- Team that wants real reporting
- Interested in faster, cheaper payments
- Comfortable with calculated risk for better returns

#### Not a Fit:
- Need 100% of cash immediately accessible at all times
- Zero risk tolerance (even for idle cash)
- Looking for guaranteed returns

**Honest Note:**
I'd rather tell you this isn't right for you than convince you to do something that doesn't fit.

If you need certainty above all else, a bank account — even at 0.5% — might be the right choice.

But if you're comfortable with calculated risk for 14x better returns AND want instant global payments? Let's talk.

### FAQ Section

**Header:** Things worth knowing

**Description:** Get answers to common questions about treasury management with diBoaS.

**CTA Text:** Schedule a conversation

#### Q: What's the catch?
Here's how we make money:

0.9% fee when you withdraw returns. If you earn €10,000, we keep €90. If you earn nothing, we earn nothing.

That's it. No hidden fees. No minimum balances.

The "catch" in your current setup? Your bank earns 7% with your money and pays you 0.5%. That €65,000 difference on €1M? That's their entire business model.

Now you've seen the math.

#### Q: Is it really liquid?
Let me be specific:

Same-day withdrawal. Request before 2 PM CET, funds in your account end of day.

No lock-ups. Your money isn't committed.

You set the floor. "Always keep €50K liquid" — we only deploy what's above that.

Most treasury tools make you choose: yield OR liquidity. We give you both.

#### Q: What's the actual risk?
Let's be honest about this:

Automated system risk: The systems your money goes into are built on code. Code can have vulnerabilities.

How we mitigate:
- Only systems with €10B+ in total value secured
- Multiple independent security audits
- Years of track record through market events
- Your money spread across multiple independent systems

Zero risk? No. Nothing is — including your bank.

The real question: Is 14x better returns worth a different risk profile?

For some founders, yes. For others, no. Both are valid.

#### Q: How do instant payments work?
Traditional wire transfers go through correspondent banks. Your bank → their bank → maybe another bank → recipient's bank. Each step takes time and charges fees.

With diBoaS, payments go direct. Your wallet → their wallet. Done.

Result: Your freelancer in Buenos Aires gets paid in their local currency, same day, at the real exchange rate, for €0 in fees.

#### Q: What about compliance?
We built diBoaS for real businesses with real compliance needs:

- Monthly statements formatted for your accounting software
- Transaction history with full audit trail
- Tax documentation at year-end
- Board-ready reports your CFO will actually understand

We know you're going to get audited eventually. We make sure you're ready.

#### Q: Where does my money actually go?
Your money is placed into proven yield-generating systems. These are:

- Established: Operating for 3+ years
- Battle-tested: Survived multiple market crashes
- Transparent: You can see exactly where your funds are at any time
- Independently audited: Security verified by third parties

Once you're a customer, you'll see the full details of each system — names, track records, and why we chose them.

We're happy to be transparent with customers. We just don't publish our exact strategy for competitors.

#### Q: Why can't you touch my money?
This is actually the whole point of how we're built.

Traditional finance: You deposit money → it becomes the bank's money → they owe you a balance.

diBoaS: Your money stays in your own wallet. We provide the software that helps you deploy it to earning systems. But we never have access to move it ourselves.

Why this matters:
- If diBoaS goes bankrupt, your money is still yours
- No one at diBoaS can steal your funds
- Every transaction requires your approval

It's a fundamentally different model. More control for you, less risk from us.

- **Best For:** Conservative long-term wealth builders who want strong returns without price swings.
- **Risk Level:** Minimal — Our highest-yielding stable strategy.

#### 10. Full Throttle
- **Badge:** Growth Potential (85%) | Wealth Building
- **Tagline:** Maximum risk. Maximum potential.
- **Description:** This is our most aggressive strategy. 85% growth exposure. Designed for a small portion of your portfolio that you're willing to lose entirely.
- **Allocation:** 15% System A + 30% System D + 35% System E + 20% System F
- **Stats:**
  - Chance of losing money: Around 27%
  - Typical annual return: Extremely variable — from large losses to extraordinary gains
  - How bumpy is the ride?: Roller coaster. At worst, your balance dropped 66% before recovering.
- **Requirements:**
  - 6+ months account age
  - Minimum balance: €1,000
  - Max 20% of your total portfolio
  - 24-hour waiting period before activation
  - Risk acknowledgment required
- **Best For:** Experienced investors with high risk tolerance allocating a small portion of their portfolio.
- **Risk Level:** Very High — Near-total loss possible. Only use what you can afford to lose completely.
- **Warning:** This isn't safe. It's for those who understand that. You could lose 78% or gain extraordinarily. Never put money here that you need.

### How To Choose Section

**Header:** Not sure where to start?

**Intro:** Here's a simple framework:

**Question 1: What's this money for?**
- Emergency fund → Safe Harbor or Stable Growth
- Something in the next 2 years → Goal Keeper or Steady Progress
- Something in 2-5 years → Patient Builder or Balanced Builder
- Long-term wealth → Steady Compounder, Wealth Accelerator, Yield Maximizer, or Full Throttle

**Question 2: How do you feel about price swings?**
- "I don't want any" → Stick to the Stable Returns column
- "I understand them and can wait out dips" → Consider the Growth Potential column
- "I'm not sure" → Start stable. Learn. You can always add growth exposure later.

**Question 3: What would you do if your balance dropped 20%?**
- "I'd panic and withdraw" → Stable Returns strategies only
- "I'd wait for it to recover" → Low-medium growth strategies
- "I'd add more money" → You might be ready for higher growth exposure

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, start conservative. You can always move up the risk spectrum. You can't undo losses from strategies you weren't ready for.

---

### FAQ Section

**Header:** Questions about strategies

#### Q: Can I switch strategies?
Yes, anytime. No penalties. No questions asked.

Here's something to keep in mind though: if you switch during a market dip, you might lock in a temporary loss.

The best time to switch is when your GOALS change, not when the market moves.

#### Q: Can I use multiple strategies at once?
Absolutely. Many people do.

Think of it like having different accounts for different purposes:
- Emergency fund in Safe Harbor
- Vacation savings in Goal Keeper
- Long-term wealth in Balanced Builder

#### Q: How does rebalancing work?
When market movements push your allocation off target (more than 10% drift), we'll notify you.

You'll see exactly what changed and why. Then you decide: approve the rebalance, or leave it as is.

We never move your money without your approval.

#### Q: Are these returns guaranteed?
No. And anyone who guarantees returns is lying to you.

What we can tell you:
- We tested every strategy across 4 years of real market data
- The numbers we show are based on what actually happened and thousands of simulations

Start with what you can afford to learn with.

#### Q: What if one of the systems has a problem?
This is a real risk. Automated systems are built on code, and code can have vulnerabilities.

We reduce this risk by:
- Only using systems that have secured $10B+ for years
- Spreading your money across multiple independent systems
- Monitoring for unusual activity 24/7

#### Q: Why are there extra requirements for Full Throttle?
Because we want to protect you from yourself.

Full Throttle can lose most of its value. The requirements aren't there to exclude you. They're there to make sure you've thought it through.

#### Q: What systems do you actually use?
We partner with established systems that have operated for years without major security incidents, secured billions of dollars, and been audited by independent security firms.

Once you join and log in, you'll see the full details of each system.

### Math Explained Section

**Header:** Why the difference is so big

**Intro:** It's not magic. It's math. Here's what's actually happening:

#### The Bank Gap
- **Headline:** Your bank earns more than they pay you
- **Body:** Banks take your deposits and put them to work — lending, investing, earning real returns. But they only share a tiny fraction with you.
- **Body 2:** A typical bank earns around 7% with your money. They pay you 0.5%. That 6.5% difference? That's their entire business model.
- **Body 3:** With diBoaS, you access the same kinds of returns they do. The gap goes to you instead.

#### Compound Interest
- **Headline:** Your earnings start earning too
- **Body:** When you earn returns, and those returns earn more returns, growth accelerates over time. At 0.5%, this barely matters. At 8%, it transforms everything.
- **Example Title:** {currency}100/month for 20 years:
  - Total deposited: {currency}24,000
  - Bank earnings: {currency}1,185 (that's 5% of what you put in)
  - diBoaS earnings: {currency}34,902 (that's 145% of what you put in)
  - **Conclusion:** The difference isn't 16x the rate. It's 29x the earnings. That's what happens when returns compound.

#### Time
- **Headline:** The longer you wait to start, the more it costs you
- **Body:** Starting 5 years earlier with {currency}100/month means tens of thousands more at the end. Every year you delay costs you future growth you'll never get back.
- **Takeaway:** The best time to start was years ago. The second best time is now.

---

### Strategy Connection Section

**Header:** The 8% isn't random

**Body:** This projection uses our most conservative strategy, called Safe Harbor. It uses only stable systems with no exposure to price swings. In our 4-year test, it never lost money.

**Body 2:** If you're comfortable with some ups and downs, other strategies have delivered higher returns:

| Strategy | What could happen | Price swing exposure |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Safe Harbor | 6-10% per year | None |
| Balanced Builder | 10-16% per year | 40% |
| Wealth Accelerator | Variable (could be negative or 50%+) | 70% |

**Note:** Higher potential returns come with bumpier rides. This calculator uses Safe Harbor because it's what we'd recommend for someone just starting out.

**CTA:** Explore all 10 strategies

---

### FAQ Section

**Header:** Questions about the calculator

#### Q: Is 8% realistic?
The 8% is in the middle of our Safe Harbor strategy's expected range (6-10% per year). We tested this strategy across 4 years of real market data, including the 2022 crash and multiple smaller drops.

Is it guaranteed going forward? No. Could it be higher or lower? Yes. But it's grounded in real data, not wishful thinking.

We use 8% instead of 10% to be conservative. We'd rather you be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.

#### Q: Why do you use 0.5% for banks?
That's the average savings account rate in the EU. Some banks pay more during promotional periods (maybe 1-2%), most pay less or even nothing. We use the average because that's what most people actually get.

If your bank pays more, great! But even at 2%, the gap between what you're earning and what's possible is still enormous.

#### Q: What about inflation?
This calculator shows the actual numbers, not adjusted for inflation.

Here's why that matters:
- At 0.5%, you're almost certainly losing purchasing power every year. Inflation eats more than you earn.
- At 8%, you're likely beating inflation and building real wealth.

The exact impact depends on future inflation, which nobody can predict. But earning 8% puts you in a much stronger position than earning 0.5%.

#### Q: Can I really start with {currency}5/month?
Yes. diBoaS has no minimum beyond {currency}5.

We believe everyone should have access to real returns, not just people with thousands to invest.

{currency}5/month for 20 years at 8% = ~{currency}2,945
That's ~{currency}1,745 in earnings on {currency}1,200 deposited.

Small? Maybe. But it's {currency}1,745 more than you'd have doing nothing.

#### Q: What if I can't save the same amount every month?
Life happens. You can adjust anytime.

This calculator assumes consistent monthly amounts because that's the easiest way to project. But diBoaS doesn't require consistency.

Some months you save {currency}200. Some months {currency}20. Some months {currency}0. The math still works — just differently. What matters is that you start.

#### Q: Which strategy should I actually use?
The calculator uses Safe Harbor as a baseline because it's:
- Our most conservative strategy
- Uses only stable systems (no price swing exposure)
- Never lost money in our 4-year test

If you're comfortable with occasional dips and have a longer timeframe, strategies with growth potential might suit you better.

#### Q: How is this different from my bank's savings account?
Three main differences:

1. Returns: Banks typically pay 0.5% or less. Our most conservative strategy targets 6-10%.

2. Where your money goes: Banks lend your money out and keep most of the returns. With diBoaS, your money goes into systems that pay you directly.

3. Control: Bank deposits become the bank's money (legally, they just owe you). With diBoaS, your money stays in your own wallet. We can't touch it.

The tradeoff? Bank deposits are insured up to {currency}100,000. diBoaS deposits are not insured, though the systems we use have secured billions safely for years.
